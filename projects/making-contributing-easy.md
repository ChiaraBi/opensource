# Making contributing easy

Any impediments and frictions in contributing to Invenio will have a direct
negative impact in terms of:

- Lack of user adoption.
- Slow onboarding of newcomers.
- Low developer motivation and moral.
- Degenerative conflicts among contributors.

It is thus of outmost importance that contributing to Invenio is as easy as
possible. The key strategic goals to address first in order to make it easy to
contribute to Invenio is:

- [Break the learning curve](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/projects/1)
- [Empower the collaboration](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/projects/2)
- [Focus the discussions](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/projects/3)

Fulfilling these strategic goals will not only make it easier to contribute to
Invenio, it will make it easier to adopt and use Invenio. In fact ease of using
Invenio is a key issue in ensuring it is also easy to contribute to Invenio.

## [Break the learning curve](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/projects/1)

Learning invenio must be easy and the current learning curve is a major
obstacle in making that happening. It must be easy to onboard new developers
fast and bring them from zero to hero in short time. This will also be directly
beneficial for external users. If we can onboard new members fast, then
external user will likely also have a much easier time trying out Invenio which
can convince them to use Invenio.

The key assets involved in breaking the learning curve are:

- the Invenio documentation
- Invenio installation process and demo sites.
- Training strategy

### The Invenio documentation

The key asset to make developers love a product is great documentation. Great
documentation however also takes a significant effort not only to produce but
also to maintain. The documentation is naturally tightly linked with the ease
of use of the product which is being dealt with in the next section. Last but
not least, CERN has a very high developer turnover due to students and limited
duration contracts, making the documentation critical for preserving knowledge.

**Actions:**

- [Reorganise the documentation to focus on specific target groups](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/12)
- [Write and maintain easy tutorials for each target group](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/13)
- [Write description/use cases of all Invenio modules and their relationships](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/14)
- [Write about architecture and design patterns used in Invenio](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/15)
- [Write guide on how to setup your development environment](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/16)
- [Write general introduction for Invenio](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/17)

### Invenio installation process and demo sites

In order to have a great documentation, the product itself must also be great
and easy to use. Efforts should be focused first on getting a realistic Invenio
up and running fast and making it easy to use this for development.

**Actions:**

- [Simplify Invenio installation](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/18)
- [Make demo sites easy to use for development purposes by use of Docker](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/19)
- [Develop one or more full-fledge Invenio demo sites](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/20)

### Training strategy

CERN has very high developer turnover meaning that significant efforts are
spent by staff to train newcomers. In addition CERN has many requests for
running Invenio trainings for externals. Streamlining training of both internal
and external developers would allow us to reduce the cost of not only training
a developer, but also further reduce costs by making developers productive much
earlier which is especially important for TECH students that stays for 1 year.

**Actions:**

- [Setup a common repository for hosting training materials and plans](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/21)
- [Setup a buddy system to help onboard new developers that makes use of e.g. pair programming](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/2)
- [Setup a bi-monthly training day for all of Invenio and define initial training plan (architecture, maintainers, ...)](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/22)
- [Define an Invenio training strategy that takes both internal and external training into account to ensure that we optimize the effort usage to run trainings](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/23)
- [Setup team building event (common one day sprint)](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/24)

## [Empower the collaboration](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/projects/2)

We must empower the collaboration to do what it takes to get their job done. We
must ensure that we have a way for developers to progressively take larger and
larger responsibility in the project with proper support for seniors. The key
issue to address in order to empower the collaboration is:

- Maintainer system
- Coordination
- Communication

### Maintainer system

The maintainer system is critical to allow more people to take part in leading
Invenio and ensuring developers/services are not blocked due to lack of
activity on the project. Allowing many developers to take part in the
leadership of Invenio however also requires very well documentation of what is
expected of each person and how to guides that define what our common practices
are.

**Actions:**

- [Document governance model to clarify roles, responsibilities, decision making and expectations (e.g. ensuring transparency of decisions)](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/25)
- [Write simplified and targeted maintainers guide, style guide and contributor guide that are user friendly](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/1)
- [Recruit and train maintainers](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/27)
- [Get maintainers to manage (assign/unassign/close) issues in managed repositories](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/28)
- [Automate package release building](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/29)

### Coordination

Allow more people to take responsibility in Invenio also requires that we spend
more effort in coordination and ensuring that we have the necessary spaces and
frameworks for coordinating decisions and efforts.

**Actions:**

- [Setup Invenio sprints](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/30)
- [Setup common knowledge base/FAQ as well as a maintenance plan of it](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/31)
- [Decrease overhead for new features by allowing prototyping in Invenio repositories](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/32)
- [Define plan for how to deal with Invenio-wide problems (raising awareness about the issue and quickly fixing the issue together to lower cost of bug rediscovery)](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/33)
- [Setup place to coordinate services and/or new features and getting advice from experts](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/34)
- [Setup service coordination meetings and technical architecture meetings](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/35)
- [Move identical code in multiple service repositories into common Invenio modules](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/36)

### Communication

Last but to least, clarifying communication channels and streamlining the
information flow in the project is critical to ensure that information reaches
the desired target groups. Also, clarifying and articulating the projectâ€™s
vision and strategy is important in providing common ground on what we base our
decisions on.

**Actions:**

- [Clarify and document communication channels](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/37)
- [Define Invenio vision, strategy & roadmap with small achievable goals clarifying: framework vs software, flavours, adoption, what are our aims](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/38)

## [Focus the discussion](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/projects/3)

The last strategic goal is to reduce the friction in contributing by ensuring
that discussion are centered around the important issues that brings value to
the product instead of being side-tracked by unimportant discussions.

**Actions:**

- [Setup nightly builds and notification system for broken packages](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/39)
- [Build tools to automate repository and package management](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/40)
- [Automate and simplify maintenance tasks including package releases](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/41)
- [Automate style checking to avoid developers spending efforts on style discussions](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/42)
- [Develop integration and acceptance tests for Invenio demo sites to detect breaking changes](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/opensource/issues/43)
